    <h2>Where the journey begun</h2>
    <p id="para1">I have started my journey to the world of photography<br>
        at very young age since my father and gradfather had a sidejob<br>
        filming local music institute concerts. They had some top of the line<br>
        gear at the time so started from the top and now we are here.</p>
