<h2> So, what about me</h2>

<p>I have studied media production with both videography and still photography in Vuoksi Kauhajoki.<br>
During my studies I got to see alot from the field! for excample I got a chance to work with Yleisradio<br>
for around 5months. Some really good children shows have been edited by me and some of them filmed also!<br>
I have also had the great opportunity to photograph some cool cars in Germany and great views in Lapland nature.<br>
